# Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego?

This work pays homage to one of the best educative games of all time. The [**page**](https://icarobernardes.github.io/carmen_sandiego_DOS/) simulates the gist of its gameplay:

### You are a detective that has to recover an important piece stolen by a V.I.L.E operative.

### By interviewing the locals you get clues about the whereabouts of the suspect and their identity.

### The adventure ends with you matching features of the criminal, issuing a arrest mandate for them and recovering the stolen item from their hideout.

## The process

This dataviz was made with R, mostly `{ggiraph}`, in Quarto. I specially like how the sprites fit really well in the piece as well as the many tricks I used to make the tooltips and hover animations. I also did some extra work with the sprites: using `{ggpath}` to put them in the page, `{ggfx}` to make borders around them and `{magick}` to manipulate images.
